# Epic Games Steam Launchers

This is a personal project to make shims for some games that I'd like to be able to stream via SteamLink that I only own on the EGS (and don't come with Cloud Save on the EGL).

Includes a template and instructions for easy modification.  Only requires changing two strings in the template to make function (the hard part is adding the shortcut to steam which is also documented in the template).

If the SteamOveraly does not work correctly for controller support with a shortcut - try adding the shortcut (powershell :: Launch Options) via GloSC instead of directly via Steam's Non-Steam game option.  It's more work but generally produces good results.
